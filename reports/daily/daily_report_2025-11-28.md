## Pulse Check
*   A flawless session on the surface: 3 wins, 0 losses, for a net profit of $850.20 after costs.
*   Profitability was strong, but without recorded stop-losses, your true risk-reward profile is a blind spot.

## Mistakes to Fix
*   Your entries were undisciplined. Adding to a position at a lower price is averaging down—a dangerous habit, even when it works.
*   Exit management was inconsistent. You closed two-thirds of your position prematurely, leaving significant profit on the table.

## Focus & Mindset
*   Guard against complacency. A 100% win rate can mask process errors. Don't let a positive outcome reinforce a flawed strategy.
*   Trade with conviction, not improvisation. A complete plan—entry, stop, and target—must exist before you ever click the button.

## Next Session
1.  Define a single, optimal entry point for each setup. No averaging down.
2.  Set one unified exit strategy for all contracts within a single trade idea.
3.  Log your planned stop-loss for every trade to validate risk and enforce discipline.
