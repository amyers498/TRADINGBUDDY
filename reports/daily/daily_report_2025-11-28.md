### Trade Review: 2025-11-28

## Pulse Check
*   A perfect 100% win rate, banking a net profit of $850 after all costs. A clean sweep.
*   This winning outcome was driven by luck, not process. The market bailed you out of a dangerous risk management mistake.

## Mistakes to Fix
*   Inverted pyramiding. Your initial entry was your worst price. Adding to a position as it moves against you is a fatal flaw.
*   Reactive sizing. You doubled down into a drawdown without a clear plan, turning a trade into a gamble. Define risk first.

## Focus & Mindset
*   Do not let profit reinforce a bad habit. The market has a long memory for undisciplined trades. Stay humble.
*   Patience is your edge. Waiting for the optimal entry would have yielded a better result with far less risk and stress.

## Next Session
1.  Set your max position size for any single setup *before* you enter.
2.  Your first entry must be your best price. Do not add to a losing position.
3.  Write down your specific price targets for profit and loss before placing the trade.
