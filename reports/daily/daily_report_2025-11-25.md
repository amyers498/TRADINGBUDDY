### **DEBRIEF: 2025-11-25**

## Pulse Check
*   You ended the day green with a 55% win rate.
*   The raw risk-reward was strong (~1.9R), but the PnL was dangerously dependent on a few oversized, emotional wins.

## Mistakes to Fix
*   Reckless position sizing. You sized up aggressively after losses—a classic revenge-trading pattern that will eventually blow up an account.
*   Letting large losses run. Three consecutive shorts created a deep hole that you had to gamble your way out of.

## Focus & Mindset
*   Process over PnL. Today’s profit masks a broken execution. Don't let a lucky outcome reinforce disastrous habits.
*   Discipline is your armor. A rigid risk plan isn't a cage—it's the only thing protecting your capital from your emotions.

## Next Session
1.  Trade with one fixed contract size for the entire session. No exceptions.
2.  Implement a "three strikes" rule: after your third loss, you are done for the day.
3.  Take a mandatory 15-minute break after any single loss greater than $100.
