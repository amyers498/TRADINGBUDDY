## Macro Pulse
*   Heightened market volatility, driven by shifting inflation expectations, created significant intraday price swings and trading opportunities.
*   Clear sector-specific trends provided a favorable environment for momentum-based setups, rewarding strong stock selection this month.

## Strategy Insights
*   The trade selection process was exceptional, delivering a perfect win rate by identifying high-probability setups.
*   Poor trade management undermined profitability. Premature exits left money on the table, while undisciplined "averaging down" tactics invalidated the initial trade thesis.

## Risk & Psychology
*   Risk management was the month's critical failure. Operating without pre-defined stop-losses exposed the account to unquantified and unacceptable risk.
*   A pattern of undisciplined entries and exits suggests decision-making was driven by fear and hope rather than a systematic plan.

## Goals for Next Month
*   Commit to a "one-shot" entry rule, eliminating the practice of averaging down.
*   Standardize a single exit strategy for all positions to maximize profit capture.
*   Log a non-negotiable stop-loss for every trade *before* execution to enforce risk discipline.
