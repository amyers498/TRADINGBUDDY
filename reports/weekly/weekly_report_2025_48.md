Based on the single report provided for this period:

### Weekly Pulse (wins/losses + momentum)
*   The week was highly profitable with a perfect 3-0 record, netting $850.20 after costs.
*   Momentum is deceptive; the 100% win rate masks a flawed process and unquantified risk due to unlogged stop-losses.

### Recurring Mistakes
*   Undisciplined entries by "averaging down" into positions, a high-risk habit.
*   Inconsistent exit strategy, which involved closing positions prematurely and leaving significant profit behind.

### Bright Spots
*   Excellent trade selection resulted in a flawless win rate for the period.
*   Strong profitability was achieved despite significant errors in trade management.

### Focus for Next Week
*   Define a single, optimal entry point for each trade and stop averaging down.
*   Establish one unified exit strategy for all contracts within a single position.
*   Log a planned stop-loss for every trade before entry to enforce risk discipline.
